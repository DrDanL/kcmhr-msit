# Military Service Identification Tool

The Military Service Identification Tool is a software package for classifying medical notes as either belonging to an individual who has or has not served (or is serving) in the military. The Tool was developed by [Dr Daniel Leightley](https://www.leightley.com/) and David Pernet from the [King's Centre for Military Health Research](https://www.kcmhr.org). The Tool development was funded by the [Forces in Mind Trust]([https://www.fim-trust.org/](https://www.fim-trust.org/)) (Project: FiMT18/0525KCL), a Â£35 million funding scheme run by the Forces in Mind Trust using an endowment awarded by the National Lottery Community Fund.  

**It is important to note that this repository is a demonstration and does not contain any data. Due to confidentiality, specific sections have been omitted. Where this is the case, more information has been provided. The Tool will not run. If you'd like to use the Tool in a specific setting please contact Dr Daniel Leightley.**

The Development of the Military Service Identification Tool: Identifying Military Veterans in a Clinical Research Database Using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning.

## Getting Started

We developed two approaches for the identification of military service, a SQL-based approach and a Python-version. You can navigate to each respective folder to view the source code and explore how each version functions.

## Availability of Materials and Data

The datasets used in this study are based on patient data, which are not publicly available. Although the data are pseudonymized, that is, personal details of the patient are removed, the data still contain information that could be used to identify a patient. Access to these data requires a formal application to the CRIS Patient Data Oversight Committee of the NIHR Biomedical Research Centre. On request and after suitable arrangements are put in place, the data and modelling employed in this study can be viewed within the secure system firewall. The corresponding author can provide more information about the process.

## Future Work

We are busy working on a revised Tool that is system agnostic and with a public example. Please subscribe to the repository to be notified when it has been released.
